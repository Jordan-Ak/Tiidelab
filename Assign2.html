<h1>This is the Second Assignment</h1>
<hr>
<p>I have learnt about different html tags so far in the class and I am applying them in this document.</p>
<p> I can make any characters <b>bold</b> as I please. I can also put <i>Italic characters</i> likewise.
    If i choose I can also tell you to <a href = https://www.google.com>Click here</a> to go to the 
    google homepage.</p>
